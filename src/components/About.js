        <p >Hi there! My name is Lakshay and I'm a Software Developer with a focus on MERN stack development. I Love building web applications and finding elegant solutions to complex problems. <br /><br />


          When I'm not coding, you can often find me exploring my other passions. I have a deep love for Singing, and enjoy expressing myself through music whenever I get the chance. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and find gardening to be a relaxing and fulfilling pastime.
          <br /><br />

          I've been an avid Chess player since I was 9 years old and have competed in many local tournaments. Chess has taught me valuable lessons about strategy, planning, and resilience, which I've been able to apply to my work as a Software Developer.</p>
